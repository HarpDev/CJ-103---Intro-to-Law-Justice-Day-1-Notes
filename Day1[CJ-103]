-Six Primary Elements of Culture

Beliefs: Defined as how the world(or ideas of how the world) operates and what is true and what is false. It can be about things that are tangible(Scientific expirimentation), intangible(Religion, philosophy). Laws often enacted to support deeply held beliefs as they change over time. [Religion Example: religious values may not be followed by everyone on a community. Although, Many laws are designed for aiding religion. Our country was founded on Christian values]

Values: Defined values that are more general and abstract than beliefs, which differ in generality and specifiality.
  American Values are Transplanted and Modified. We have taken our values from other countries and blended them together into american culture, and Shared values are an important binding force.
 {Examples of broad and general values:[GoldenRule(
      TreatOthersTheWayYouWantToBeTreated),  
      Open, peaceful discussions with those of different beliefs of people,
      General assumptions of equality and treating everyone the same, 
      Generally not klling, stealing, rape, etc etc. ]}

Norms: Defined as the "action" component of a value or belief, that patterns social behavior in ways consistent with those values or beliefs.

            Morey Norms with Serious Moral Connetations (Stealing, gr@pe, murder, adultery[maybe?] public nudity, ince$t, P3dophilla)

            Folkways: Less serious Norms. Not usually enforced by laws (Tipping, Keeping your dog/child under control in a public setting, returning shopping cart, 
                              picking up dog poop, General Manners/Decency, Cleaning up after yourself, Treatment and cleanliness of public bathrooms/services, noise pollution
                               NOT TYPING IN ALL FULL CAPS, not interrupting, pleasuring chick-fl-a workers)
